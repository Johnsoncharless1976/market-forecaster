TASK:
Guardrails & Audit Hardening
Expand audits: duplicates, gaps, schema checks, thresholds; update summary.csv with explicit counts; failing metrics trigger non-zero exit in CI.

CONSTRAINTS:
Produce complete, copy/paste-ready scripts with headers (File, Title, Commit Notes).
No placeholders. Include how to run and where to save files in repo.
Prefer Python + PowerShell for runners; Snowflake via SQLAlchemy; idempotent MERGE; clear logs.
