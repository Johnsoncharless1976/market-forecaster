- The OHLC (Open, High, Low, Close) data passed sanity checks.
- There were no gaps in the true weekday data.
- There were no weekend rows in the data.

STATUS: Green
The data ingestion process appears to be functioning correctly, with no significant issues identified.

Remediation Plan: N/A

Metrics:
- All metrics are zero, indicating no gaps, duplicates, or rejections.
- The holiday_weekdays count is also zero, which is acceptable since the true_weekday_gaps are zero.
