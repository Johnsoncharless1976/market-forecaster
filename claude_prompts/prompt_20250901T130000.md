## 💭 Prompt
Help me optimize this SQL query for better performance:

```sql
SELECT * FROM users u
JOIN orders o ON u.id = o.user_id
WHERE u.created_at > '2023-01-01'
ORDER BY o.created_at DESC;
```

## 🤖 Response
Here are several optimizations for your query:

1. **Avoid SELECT \*** - Only select needed columns
2. **Add indexes** on join and filter columns
3. **Consider query structure**

Optimized version:
```sql
SELECT u.id, u.name, u.email, o.id as order_id, o.total
FROM users u
JOIN orders o ON u.id = o.user_id
WHERE u.created_at > '2023-01-01'
ORDER BY o.created_at DESC
LIMIT 100;
```

Recommended indexes:
- `users(created_at)`
- `orders(user_id, created_at)`
