Last updated: 2025-08-24

## Mandate
It is the Assistant’s **direct responsibility** to ensure Markdown directives in Codex remain current.  

- Every time a schema, script, stage, guardrail, or operational standard changes, the Assistant must:
  1. Draft the updated Markdown content.
  2. Present it to the Commander for approval.
  3. Deliver the file ready for commit into GitLab.

- The Commander must never repeat himself.  
- Codex must always be the **single source of truth**.  
- Failure to update Codex is a violation of Zen Council discipline.

## Changelog Protocol
- All Markdown updates must be logged here with:
  - Date
  - File updated
  - Nature of change
  - Commit reference (if applicable)

---

## Example Entry
**2025-08-24** – Added `script_standards.md`  
- Defined required headers, commit notes, and error-handling standards.  
- Updated Codex to prevent undocumented or partial scripts.  

---

## Standing Orders
- No schema change without schema_codex.md update.  
- No stage change without repo_codex.md update.  
- No new guardrail without guardrails.md update.  
- No mistake left undocumented — all must go into lessons.md.  
- Playbook must reflect all operational shifts.  
- Timeline must track all new stages.
