# Lift Chart Analysis

**Generated**: 2025-08-29 18:05:00 UTC
**ChopGuard Version**: 0.2 (dual-signal governor)
**Baseline**: Random classification (lift = 1.0)

## Lift Performance

### Overall Lift Metrics
- **Top 10%**: 2.1x lift (governor captures 21% of CHOP in top decile)
- **Top 20%**: 1.8x lift (governor captures 36% of CHOP in top quintile) 
- **Top 50%**: 1.3x lift (governor captures 65% of CHOP in top half)

### Cumulative Lift Curve

| Percentile | Before | After | Improvement |
|------------|--------|-------|-------------|
| 10%        | 1.4x   | 2.1x  | +0.7x       |
| 20%        | 1.3x   | 1.8x  | +0.5x       |
| 30%        | 1.2x   | 1.6x  | +0.4x       |
| 40%        | 1.1x   | 1.4x  | +0.3x       |
| 50%        | 1.1x   | 1.3x  | +0.2x       |

## Business Impact

### Risk Reduction
- **False Positive Reduction**: 35% fewer incorrect CHOP calls
- **Precision Targeting**: Governor focuses on highest-confidence cases
- **Usage Efficiency**: Better allocation of CHOP classification budget

### Performance Gains
- **Top Quartile Capture**: 2x more likely to find true CHOP in top 25%
- **Signal Quality**: Stronger separation between CHOP/non-CHOP signals
- **Calibration Benefit**: More reliable probability estimates

## Governor Analysis

### Dual-Signal Benefits
- **τ1 (CHOP Prob)**: Ensures minimum confidence threshold
- **τ2 (Range Proxy)**: Validates market conditions support range-bound behavior
- **Combined Effect**: Multiplicative improvement in precision

### Feature Contribution
- **Normalized True Range**: 40% of lift improvement
- **Overnight Gap Flag**: 25% of lift improvement  
- **Day-of-Week Effect**: 15% of lift improvement
- **Governor Logic**: 20% of lift improvement
