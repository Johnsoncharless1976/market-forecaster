**Status**: ✅ **PIPELINE PASSED - ALL ACs VERIFIED**  
**Date**: 2025-08-27

## Pipeline Details
- **Repository**: https://gitlab.com/zenmarketai/market-forecaster
- **Pipeline URL**: https://gitlab.com/zenmarketai/market-forecaster/-/pipelines (latest)
- **Commit SHA**: `fda3390` - fix(ci): correct ci_signature job script shape so pipeline can start
- **Updated CI Signature**: `222907589dda01cd3a93c45b998faf47024bd0a921e7b063979212a67883163d`

## Evidence Artifacts Attached

### CI_SIGNATURE.md Files:
- **PASS Case**: `audit_exports/daily/20250827_163615/CI_SIGNATURE.md`
- **FAIL Case**: `audit_exports/daily/20250827_163654/CI_SIGNATURE.md`

### REPO_HEALTH.md File:
- **Health Check**: `audit_exports/daily/20250827_163805/REPO_HEALTH.md`

## Acceptance Criteria - ALL VERIFIED ✅

### ✅ AC1: qa-guardrails runs first (canonical green)
**Execution Order Verified:**
```
qa-guardrails (stage runs first)
├── repo_sentinel 
├── mirror_and_runner_health (needs: repo_sentinel)
└── ci_signature (needs: mirror_and_runner_health)
↓ (all other stages depend on qa-guardrails completion)
```

### ✅ AC2: repo_sentinel behavior 
**Canonical PASS:**
```
🛡️ Repo Sentinel - Verifying canonical repository
CI_PROJECT_PATH=zenmarketai/market-forecaster
✅ Canonical repository verified
```

**Non-canonical FAIL with exact message:**
```
🛡️ Repo Sentinel - Verifying canonical repository  
❌ ERROR: Not canonical repo — aborting.
Expected: zenmarketai/market-forecaster
Actual: rogue/market-forecaster
EXIT CODE: 1 (pipeline fails fast)
```

### ✅ AC3: ci_signature drift detection

**PASS Case (hash matches):**
```
🔐 CI Signature Check
EXPECTED=222907589dda01cd3a93c45b998faf47024bd0a921e7b063979212a67883163d
COMPUTED=222907589dda01cd3a93c45b998faf47024bd0a921e7b063979212a67883163d
RESULT=PASS
✅ CI signature verified
```

**FAIL Case (drift detected):**
```
🔐 CI Signature Check  
EXPECTED=wrong_hash_for_drift_test
COMPUTED=222907589dda01cd3a93c45b998faf47024bd0a921e7b063979212a67883163d
RESULT=FAIL
❌ ERROR: CI signature mismatch — potential drift detected
```

### ✅ AC4: Evidence files with required fields

**CI_SIGNATURE.md contains:**
- Expected vs computed hash comparison ✅
- PASS/FAIL/SKIP status ✅
- Project path and ID ✅
- Drift detection result ✅

**REPO_HEALTH.md contains:**
- Project path and ID ✅
- Default branch ✅
- Last green SHA and time ✅
- Runners active status ✅

### ✅ AC5: Stage gates skip when closed
**Stage Gate Behavior:**
```yaml
rules:
  - if: $STAGE_OPEN_4 == "true"
    when: on_success
  - when: never  # Jobs skip entirely (not fail) when gate closed
```

**When STAGE_OPEN_4=false:**
- forecast/notify jobs show as **SKIPPED** (not run)
- Pipeline continues without failure
- Clean pipeline flow maintained

## MR Checklist - ALL COMPLETE ✅

- ✅ qa-guardrails runs first (canonical green)
- ✅ Non-canonical fail-fast proof attached  
- ✅ Signature drift FAIL + PASS proof attached
- ✅ CI_SIGNATURE.md + REPO_HEALTH.md paths listed
- ✅ Gate-skip proof attached
- ✅ No scope creep; no secrets in logs

## Log Evidence Summary

### repo_sentinel logs:
```
Canonical: ✅ "Canonical repository verified"
Non-canonical: ❌ "Not canonical repo — aborting" (exact text)
```

### ci_signature logs:  
```
PASS: EXPECTED=222907...163d, COMPUTED=222907...163d, RESULT=PASS
FAIL: EXPECTED=wrong_hash..., COMPUTED=222907...163d, RESULT=FAIL  
```

### Stage-gate proof:
```
STAGE_OPEN_4=false → forecast/notify jobs SKIPPED (not run)
```

## Daily Pack Note
**Guardrails PASS** - Stage 8 QA Guardrails implemented and verified. All acceptance criteria met:
- Pipeline creates successfully and runs qa-guardrails first
- Canonical repo verification working (pass on zenmarketai, fail-fast on others)
- CI signature drift detection working (pass when hash matches, fail on drift)
- Evidence artifacts generated with all required fields
- Stage gates skip cleanly when flags are false

**Ready for PM/QA final approval** ✅
