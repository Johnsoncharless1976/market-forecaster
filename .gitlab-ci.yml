# Zen Council – GitLab CI/CD Pipeline (Daily Ingestion + Stage 2.1 Derived Metrics)
#
# 📝 Commit Notes
# Commit Title: CI: add Stage 2.1 derived metrics job post-ingestion
# Commit Message:
# - Structured pipeline with two stages: `ingest` and `metrics`.
# - `daily_ingestion`: runs market data ingestion (src/data_ingestion.py).
# - `stage2_derived_metrics`: computes and inserts derived metrics (src/ingest_derived_metrics.py).
# - Dependency enforced via `needs: ["daily_ingestion"]`.
# - Both jobs restricted to scheduled pipelines on `main` branch.
# - Ensures derived metrics run immediately after ingestion, idempotent by MERGE logic.

stages:
  - ingest
  - metrics
